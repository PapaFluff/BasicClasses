# BasicClasses
Design a class that has an array of floating-point numbers. The default constructor should create a dynamically allocated array of 10 elements. The overloaded constructor should accept an integer argument and dynamically allocate the array to hold that many numbers.  The destructor should free the memory held by the array.
